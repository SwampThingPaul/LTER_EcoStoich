# Evlauation of Ecological Stoichiometry within the Florida Coastal Everglades LTER

Previous and ongoing work related to ecological stoichiometry wwithin the Florida Coastal Everglades LTER

#### Study Area
The Florida Coastal Everglades Long Term Ecological Research program (FCE-LTER) consists of 17 long-term monitoring locations within Everglades National Park located in extreme south Florida. Everglades National Park is located at the southern-most extent of the Everglades Protection Area and receives surface water from Water Conservation Area 3A and Big Cypress National Preserve (Osborne et al 2011). Everglades National Park has two major drainages, Shark River Slough (SRS) and Taylor Slough (TS). Shark River Slough is the major water flow-pathway through ENP, and is approximately 32 kilometer (km) wide along the northern border, narrowing to approximately 10 km near its discharge point at the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). This area has relatively low elevation and maintains a long hydroperiod facilitating the accretion of organic matter (Bazante et al 2006; Osborne et al 2011). TS is the second largest water flow path through the southeastern portion of the ENP. Upper reaches of TS are narrow, elevations are relatively high, the hydroperiod is relatively short, and soils are relatively low in organic matter. The Panhandle (Ph) portion of the ENP is located adjacent to TS, characterized as a marl prairie with shallow carbonate soils. The primary source of surface water to the Ph region is from the C-111 canal during the wet season, and thus this region experiences a very short hydroperiod (Ross et al 2000).

Vegetation and ecosystem characteristics in ENP vary along a salinity gradient. The freshwater landscapes within ENP are dominated by a ridge and slough topography interspersed with sawgrass marshes and tree islands. Ecotone regions grade from freshwater to brackish environments and are characterized by oligohaline, mixed marsh/mangrove forests. Farther downstream in more saline water are fringing mangroves. Finally, Florida Bay receives seawater from the GoM and a small volume of freshwater runoff from ENP and is characterized as a seagrass-dominated marine environment (Chambers and Pederson 2006; Childers 2006). For the purposes of this study, ENP has been divided into three hydrologic regions including SRS, TS and Ph with the monitoring sites established to capture variation in ecosystem types amongst these regions.

## Is the Everglades Ecosystem a Stoichiometric Deviant? An Investigation of Ecological Stoichiometry Along the Aquatic Contnuum of the Everglades Ecosystem.
This study was presented as a poster-presentation at the [2018 FCE LTER All-Scientist Meeting](http://fcelter.fiu.edu/about_us/meetings/asm2018/) in Miami May 7-8, 2018. This work is currently being developed into a manuscript.
