## Reference Formats:

General reference formatting should follow a standarized format. For purposes of this [project page](https://github.com/SwampThingPaul/LTER_EcoStoich) we will follow the reference guideslines of [Wetlands](https://www.springer.com/life+sciences/ecology/journal/13157?detailsPage=pltci_3338316).

Citations within the text, they should be cited chronologically (oldest to newest),
The list of references should only include works that are cited in the text and that have been published or accepted for publication. Personal communications and unpublished works should only be mentioned in the text.
Do not use footnotes or endnotes as a substitute for a reference list.
Reference list entries should be alphabetized by the last names of the first author of each work. All journal names must be written out in full.
