# Ecological stoichiometry through the lens of long-term data: Using stoichiometry to understand dynamic ecological systems. 

This project came to fruishion as a proposed session for the [2018 Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) All-Scientist Meeting (ASM)](https://lternet.edu/lter-scientists-meeting-2018/).

## Overview
The overarching theme of ecological stoichiometric theory is to understand the coupling of energy to nutrient biogeochemical cycles as mediated by the demands and constraints of homeostasis and thermodynamics. Stoichiometric homeostasis is loosely defined as the degree to which organisms maintain elemental stoichiometry relative to the ambient environment. Stoichiometric homeostasis however, is not fixed, rather it can vary among and within organisms. Processes such plant and microbial uptake efficiency and nutrient resorption influence site specific nutrient cycles resulting in a strong feedback mechanism altering the mass-balance between ecosystems compartments (i.e. water column, soil, vegetation, etc.)  and a cascade of stoichiometric pressures causing variability and disproportionate stoichiometry across the system. External drivers also have the potential to influence ecosystem scale stoichiometry including, sea-level rise (coastal ecosystems), climatic variability, thawing of permafrost and increasing in ice-free days (Arctic ecosystems), altered fire frequency and patterns (forested ecosystems), lithology and critical zone structure, changes to upstream watersheds influencing timing and delivery of water and nutrients, invasive species, and ecosystem management. 

The application of long-term data to understand the temporal and spatial variability of ecological stoichiometry across biomes is a novel approach at ecosystem level understanding. Sites within the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network include several biomes that span a climate gradient with variable internal complexities and external pressures. Each site can be highly dynamic with countless biotic-abiotic interactions which influences local ecology. These interactions lead to ecosystem level complexities that influence and drive site and system biogeochemical cycling and productivity. Individual LTER sites have experienced localized effects of large scale changes to climate, disturbance, water resources, restoration, environmental regulation, etc. all of which interact with internal and external pressures that can lead to system-level changes. Synthesis of this information can yield new insight into the biogeochemical cycling of essential elements and provide a deeper understanding of ecosystem function and ecosystem productivity at the site and network level. 

## Goal
The objective of this work is to stimulate cross-site syntheses related to biogeochemical cycling of energy and nutrients and to better understanding mechanisms that control productivity. The primary goal of this work is to foster collaborative synthesis between LTER sites related to ecological stoichiometry. 

## Where and what is an LTER site
LTER sites (and their international counterparts; [ILTER](https://www.ilter.network/)) are located around the world. These sites with a rich history of ecological inquiry, collaboration across a wide range of research topics, and engagement with students, educators, and community members. More information on LTER sites and the LTER program visit the visit the [NSF LTER webpage](https://lternet.edu/).
